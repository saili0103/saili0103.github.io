I am a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my PhD degree at Department of Statistics, Rutgers Univeristy.

My research interests include estimation and inference in high-dimensional models with genetic applications, transfer learning algorithms to borrow information across studies, and causal inference in existence of invalid instrumental variables with applications to Mendelian Randomization.
