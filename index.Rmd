Welcome! I am currently an associate professor (without tenure) at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China.

I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my PhD degree at Department of Statistics, Rutgers Univeristy.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

My research interests include:

1. Methods for estimation and inference in high-dimensional models with genetic applications. 

2. New methods and statistical guarantees for machine learning topics.

3. Causal inference in existence of invalid instrumental variables with applications to Mendelian Randomization.
