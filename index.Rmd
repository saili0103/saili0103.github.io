I am a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at University of Pennsylvania. 

I obtained my PhD degree at Department of Statistics, Rutgers Univeristy.

&nbsp;

My research interests include:

1. Estimation and inference in high-dimensional models with genetic applications. 

2. Transfer learning algorithms to borrow information across studies.

3. Causal inference in existence of invalid instrumental variables with applications to Mendelian Randomization.
